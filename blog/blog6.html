            In these past two weeks, we were introduced to React, a JavaScript library that's used for building user
            interfaces, and Express, a Node.js web application framework. React helps with concurrency of actions
            between user and the model. With React, we will only
            have to have one HTML file rather than many and React will populate the html for us. In class, we also found
            out that in React, onChange and onInput doesn't really have a difference. In normal JavaScript, onInput
            occurs immediately when an element gets user input and onChange occurs when the element loses focus or after
            it's been changed such as clicking/moving the cursor away from the element. In class and lectures, we also
            learned how to
            write a web service using Express.

            Earlier this week, I read <a href="https://www.simform.com/why-use-react/" target="_blank">this article</a>
            about why people use React in the real world today. One of the reasons is because it's easier to learn for
            developers because it's easy to grasp if you're familiar with Javascript. React has a smoother learning
            curve than AngularJS, another JavaScript framework. Another reason is that React lets you reuse components.
            This decreases the amount of duplicate code. For example, you could have several submit buttons on your page
            and in regular HTML and JS, you'd have to make a seperate element for each of those even though they have
            the same functionality. In React, you could just make one button component and use that several times
            throughout the page. React also provides a unique abstraction layer which is a good thing because this means
            that the end-user won't be able to access the internals and so this provides a good extra measure of
            security. Lastly, another reason why people use React in web development today is because it's well
            established and has a variety of ready-made and customizable components like charts, graphics, etc. This
            makes it faster and easier to develop complex web pages.

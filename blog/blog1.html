            Under the guidance and help of five lectures, four labs, and a lot of google searches, I think I've learned
            a good amount about HTML and CSS basics. A few things I've learned about so far are:
        <ul>
            <li>flex box</li>
            <li>box model</li>
            <li>sizing</li>
            <li>alignment</li>
        </ul>
        Flex boxes and box models were completely new to me and after learning about both, I
        can see how useful they are. They enable us to place components on the page in certain places without having to
        use a rigid structure like a grid or table. I also didn't know about vh, vw, and em for sizing before. I had
        only ever used px for css sizes and lengths. I didn't know there were so many types of alignments as well, such
        as space-between, flex-start, flex-end, baseline, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also recently learned about navigation bars in this class and wanted to make one for this blog site so I
            can easily go back to the main blog list. However, I knew that this code would be repeated across all the
            pages I make and so I looked up a way to make it so I don't have so much repeated code. I was able to make
            the navagation bar in a seperate html file. Then, I called and loaded it on the page using javascript. I'm
            not too sure if this is the best way to do this implementation, but as I learn more from this class, I'll
            most likely be able to replace it with something more efficent.
        </p>

            Another thing I re-created from the lectures
            is the monocolumn. This is shown on the blog's index html page. I wanted the box-shadow on the sides of the
            column but not on the top and bottom. I wasn't sure how to fix that though.

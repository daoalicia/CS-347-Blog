            This week in class we more about JavaScript and its components/objects. It was originally meant to be a
            client and server language. Today, it has become a scripting language used to create and control dynamic
            website content. There are three keywords to declare variables in JS. They are let, var, and const. The var
            statement declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable. The let statement declares a block-scoped
            local variable, meaning the variable cannot be accessed from outside the block. The const statement requires
            the variable to be assigned a value when declared and cannot be reassigned. However out of these three, we
            will only be using let and const because var is outdated and buggy. Some other new things I learned about
            were spread syntax and optional chaining. We also learned about alerts which is similar to a pop up on a
            webpage and so I have a code example of an alert in JavaScript that's also being used on this blog page. The
            alert appears when the user has entered their name and clicked submit.

        <pre>
                <code>
                    const submitButton = document.getElementById('submit');
                    const name = document.getElementById('name');

                    submitButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
                        alert(`Hello ${name.value}!`);
                    });
                </code>
            </pre>

            Outside of class, I wanted to learn more about Bootstrap and WordPress. I had briefly learned Bootstrap on
            my own last semester to challenge myself and use it on a database class project. I haven't used WordPress at
            all, but I know it's quite popular in web development too. Somehow I passed the LinkedIn Assessment for it
            even
            though I've never used it, so I wanted to learn more about it. From <a
                href="https://medium.com/@saschathattil/wordpress-vs-bootstrap-what-to-use-for-building-a-website-3253d4759376">this
                article</a>, I was able to learn more about the two and their differences as well as when it would be
            best to use them. Bootstrap is a CSS framework to aid in
            building websites and focuses on design. Bootstrap does not have that much overhead or a huge number of
            functionalities. It also loads faster than WordPress. WordPress is a content management system and focuses
            more on
            backend functionalities. It's possible to use both of them together.

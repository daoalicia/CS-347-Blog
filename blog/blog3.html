            This week, we learned about aboslute positioning. When an element is positioned absoutely, it anchors itself
            to the nearest ancestor that has non-static positioning. Since the default positioning for elements is
            static, this means that we have to set the parent element that we want the child to anchor to with relative
            positioning instead. Another cool thing we learned this week was how to mimic powerpoint slides and their
            transitions in lab 7/8.My group struggled with the transitions but after seeing the solution, we saw that we
            overthought it and
            made it much more complicated than needed. Part of the error was because we were trying to use transition
            instead of transform.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was interested in finding other ways to use absolute positioning on a web page, so I looked up other
            examples and came across this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUaw-AA9HnA&ab_channel=KevinPowell"
                alt="link to YouTube video" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> tutorial on practical examples for this
            positioning. Not only was it very helpful with making me understand positioning better, but I got to learn
            some new things about CSS such as calc and rem. I have a better understanding of how to use rem and em now
            after watching his tutorial.

            Some example CSS code used in the video that I slightly altered and recreated while watching the video is
            shown below and also appears embedded on
            this blog post:

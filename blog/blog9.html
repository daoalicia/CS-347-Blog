        <p>
            If I were teaching CS 347 next fall (assuming to be fully online like this semester), I think I would
            structure the class similarly to how Dr. Johnson taught this course because it worked really well. Students
            would learn about the material
            through video lectures so they can learn at their own pace/time and go back to it for a refresher, but it
            would be on a different platform than YouTube. There was nothing bad about the quality
            of the lectures on YouTube, but I think a different platform would be more suitable. After a video ends on
            YouTube, recommended videos pop up, which may distract students. The new platform for the lecture videos
            would also have a comment section underneath (students would have to login to make a comment to verify
            they're a part
            of the class and not a random user) so students can write any questions they had on that specific video
            and/or help one another. </p>
        <p> During class would still be group lab work. I think this would work best in person
            (if
            possible), so
            that it's clear that everyone is contributing because there were some groups where some individuals
            contributed minimal work. Also by having in person labs, other groups may be able to get their questions
            answered faster requesting help from the professor or overhearing the professor's advice to another group.
            Of course if classes can't be held in person, zoom breakout rooms are still good. I think the labs were very
            helpful and made us understand the material a lot better. I think I learned the most through coding along
            with the lecture and actually retained the information better through the labs. </p>
        <p>The only other thing I would
            change about the course is that I would introduce react and express a bit earlier just so there would be
            more time to go further in depth with this material as I found it more difficult than the HTML/CSS/JS part
            of the class. Being able to view the solutions to the lab also helped with seeing how our solution compares
            and how we can write our code more efficiently.

            This week in class we learned a bit more about Express and React and as well as an introduction to Redux.
            Redux helps in situations where you have prop drilling, which is when a parent receives data that it doesn't
            need and passes it on. There are three basic ideas about Redux: the data store, actions, and a reducer. The
            data store is like a global collection of our data that's owned at the root level. If a child wants to make
            changes to the data store, it can trigger actions which allows it to do so without having to pass back
            through the parent. The reducer is a function that takes in two parameters, the old state and an action, and
            it gives back the new state. State changes have to be applied to the data store that Redux manages and this
            is done by through a function called dispatch. It takes in one parameter which is an action object with two
            keys: type (string) and payload (data associated with action).
        </p>

            To learn more about why we should use React Redux and how it's currently used in the real world, I looked at
            the react-redux website and found this <a href="https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/why-use-react-redux"
                target="_blank">article</a>. Redux isn't limited to just React because it's a standalone library. This
            means it can also be used with any other UI layer or framework. To do this, you can use a UI binding library
            to tie the two together. This makes it easier for developers to incorporate it into their desired UI
            framework. Redux was originally designed and intended for use with React though. This makes React Redux
            consistently up-to-date with API changes and ensures that React components act as expected. Redux also makes
            states predictable because "if the same state and action are passed to a reducer, the same result is always
            produced because reducers are pure functions"(<a
                href="https://blog.logrocket.com/why-use-redux-reasons-with-clear-examples-d21bffd5835/"
                target="_blank">source</a>). Another reason is that Redux can be used for server-side rendering and
            debugging is easier through action and state logging.

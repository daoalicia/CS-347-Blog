            During this week's lectures and labs, I learned more about flexboxes and their sizing. We used flex-grow for
            expansions and flex-basis for sizing the flex-children. I also learned how positioning works. There's
            relative positioning, fixed positioning, and absolute positioning (which we're learning next week).
            Positioning has been shown to be useful for anchoring components such as notices on sites or health guages
            for games.
            <br>
            Some example code of using a notice with fixed positioning that also appears on this blog post:
            <br>
        <pre>
                <code>
                    &lt;style&gt;
                        #notice {
                            background-color: lightgreen;
                            color: white;
                            font-size: 1.5em;
                            font-family: sans-serif;
                            padding: 10px;
                            position: fixed;
                            bottom: 0;
                            right: 0;
                            margin: 10px;
                            display: flex;
                            flex-direction: row;
                            justify-content: space-between;
                            align-items: flex-start;
                        }

                        #notice:hover {
                            transition: background-color 0.5s ease-in;
                            background-color: lightpink;
                        }

                        #close-button {
                            color: black;
                            cursor: pointer;
                        }
                    &lt;/style&gt;
                    &lt;div id="notice"&gt;
                        Hover to shift color and click on the 'x' to close.
                        &lt;span id="close-button"&gt;&amp;#x2716;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;script&gt;
                        const notice = document.getElementById('notice');
                        const closeButton = document.getElementById('close-button');

                        closeButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
                            notice.style.display = 'none';
                        });
                    &lt;/script&gt;

            This week, I also read two short articles (
            <a href="https://www.hiddenbrains.com/blog/angular-vs-reactjs.html" alt="source one" target="_blank">source
                1</a>
            ,
            <a href="https://wiredelta.com/angularjs-vs-reactjs-vs-vuejs/" alt="source two" target="_blank">source 2</a>
            ) on the differences between AngularJS, ReactJS, and VueJS. Over the summer, I had a software engineering
            internship and was able to learn a bit about AngularJS/Angular 2. I know that we will be learning ReactJS
            this upcoming semester and I was curious about the similarities and differences between the two. Both use
            and support JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. One main difference between them is that AngularJS is a framework
            and ReactJS is library. Another difference is that ReactJS uses Virtual Document Object Model (DOM), which
            increases speed and only updates areas where changes have occurred, and
            AngularJS uses Real DOM, which automatically updates the entire tree when you make a change to a single data
            structure. AngularJS was developed by Google and ReactJS was developed by Facebook.

    <div id="notice">
        Hover to shift color and click on the 'x' to close.
        <span id="close-button">&#x2716;</span>
    </div>

    <script>
        const notice = document.getElementById('notice');
        const closeButton = document.getElementById('close-button');

        closeButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
            notice.style.display = 'none';
        });
    </script>

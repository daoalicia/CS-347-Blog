            This week in class we learned about media queries, forms, and CSS grid displays. I thought it was really
            interesting to see how we can transform a webpage using CSS to make it more user-friendly and readable on a
            mobile device. Another new thing I learned was the display: grid option in CSS. Prior to this course, I only
            knew how to make a "grid" layout by using a table in HTML, so learning about this instead sounds much more
            convenient to use for information and elements that aren't data related. I definitely will be using this
            layout for my project 1 assignment, as well as the form inputs. Below is some short CSS code to demonstrate
            the media query on this blog post. This code will execute when the width of the page is 600px or less.

        <pre>
                <code>
                    @media (max-width: 600px) {
                        body {
                            background-color: darkviolet;
                        }
                    
                        #title {
                            background-color: gold;
                        }
                    }
                    
                </code>

            To make a draft of what I wanted my website to look like for project 1, I used a tool called Figma. However,
            I didn't really know much about this design tool and wasn't able to create a fully functioning prototype
            through it, just static pages/snapshots. So this week, I wanted to learn more about Figma to help with
            designing prototypes for future projects (in this class and outside of it). I used this <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXg2fQxeYK8&ab_channel=KevinPowell"
                alt="Video about Figma">Youtube video</a> to get a better understanding and basic tutorial on Figma. I
            think it was really cool how this video covered both desktop and mobile viewports. I was also able to learn
            many tricks and shortcuts on creating and placing elements in the tool that would've very helpful to know
            before project 1. It definitely would've saved me so much more time. The video also gave good tips on how to
            properly make a webpage landing page with visible hierarchy, accent colors, proper alignment, and color
            contrasting.
